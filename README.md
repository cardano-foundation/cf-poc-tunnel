# Project Tunnel

### Overview

**Project Tunnel** is a cutting-edge browser extension that introduces passwordless authentication and replaces traditional HTTPS with the **[KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) Protocol](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/)**. This extension acts as a secure bridge between websites and the Cardano Foundation's [cf-identity-wallet](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-identity-wallet), leveraging decentralized identity technology to ensure safe and private web interactions.

### Key Features

1. **Interactive Passwordless Authentication:**  
   Project Tunnel transforms user authentication on websites by implementing a passwordless system that involves user participation. Upon visiting a website and opting to create an account, the site requests the user to link a temporary AID, generated by the extension, with a permanent AID and credential in their wallet. The user must actively approve this link to initiate and authorize subsequent sessions, enabling secure encryption and decryption of web communications.

2. **Revolutionary Security Protocol Replacement:**  
   The extension replaces traditional HTTPS with KERI-based encryption, encrypting each request from the user's browser using a unique ephemeral identifier (eAID) for each website. This process ensures all communications are securely transmitted and managed.

3. **Server-Side Decryption and Identity Verification:**  
   Equipped with the public identifier of the ephemeral eAID and linked to a credential in the user's mobile wallet, servers can decrypt requests and verify identities using KERI's secure protocols, eliminating the need for HTTPS.

4. **Secure Response Handling:**  
   When the server sends responses, the extension decrypts them using the private key of the ephemeral identifier tailored to the specific website, ensuring secure end-to-end encryption for all communications.

### Why KERI Over HTTPS?

Project Tunnel leverages KERI-based ephemeral identifiers to enhance security beyond traditional HTTPS, providing unique, one-time encryption keys for each session. This method boosts privacy and allows secure, reliable identity verification without the need for passwords, revolutionizing web request and response encryption and decryption.
