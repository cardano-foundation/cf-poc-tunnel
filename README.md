> **Disclaimer:**
>
> - **Support for Project Tunnel in the ID Wallet is currently not available**. This project was initially developed as a Proof of Concept (PoC), and the integration will be resumed when we have the capacity to do so.
> - The **ESSR payloads are not currently using native CESR** due to its unavailability at the time of development. Future updates may incorporate this feature as it becomes supported.
> - For enhanced confidentiality and security, it is recommended to **use a single REST endpoint with routed messages**, rather than exposing multiple endpoints.


### Overview

**Project Tunnel** is a cutting-edge browser extension that introduces passwordless authentication and replaces traditional HTTPS with the **[KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) Protocol](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/)**. This extension acts as a secure bridge between websites and the Cardano Foundation's [cf-identity-wallet](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-identity-wallet), leveraging decentralized identity technology to ensure safe and private web interactions.

### Key Features

1. **Interactive Passwordless Authentication:**  
   Project Tunnel transforms user authentication on websites by implementing a passwordless system that involves user participation. Upon visiting a website and opting to create an account, the site requests the user to link a temporary AID, generated by the extension, with a permanent AID and credential in their wallet. The user must actively approve this link to initiate and authorize subsequent sessions, enabling secure encryption and decryption of web communications.

2. **Revolutionary Security Protocol Replacement:**  
   The extension replaces traditional HTTPS with KERI-based encryption, encrypting each request from the user's browser using a unique ephemeral identifier (eAID) for each website. This process ensures all communications are securely transmitted and managed.

3. **Server-Side Decryption and Identity Verification:**  
   Equipped with the public identifier of the ephemeral eAID and linked to a credential in the user's mobile wallet, servers can decrypt requests and verify identities using KERI's secure protocols, eliminating the need for HTTPS.

4. **Secure Response Handling:**  
   When the server sends responses, the extension decrypts them using the private key of the ephemeral identifier tailored to the specific website, ensuring secure end-to-end encryption for all communications.

### Why KERI Over HTTPS?

Project Tunnel leverages KERI-based ephemeral identifiers to enhance security beyond traditional HTTPS, providing unique, one-time encryption keys for each session. This method boosts privacy and allows secure, reliable identity verification without the need for passwords, revolutionizing web request and response encryption and decryption.

## Getting Started

### Project Structure

**Project Tunnel** is organized into several key components to facilitate development and deployment. Below is a breakdown of the major elements:

#### Demo Environment
The `demo` directory encapsulates the demonstration environment, which includes both a server-side application and a user interface to showcase the extension's capabilities.

- **Server (`demo/server`):** This contains all the server-side logic required to support the extension, including API endpoints, middleware for encryption and verification, and the configuration files needed for deployment. The server is containerized using Docker, facilitating easy setup and scalability.

- **User Interface (`demo/ui`):** The UI provides a frontend display to interact with the extension, demonstrating its features in a real-world scenario. This part of the demo includes all frontend assets, configuration for nginx, and is also prepared for Docker deployment.

#### Extension Implementation
The core implementation of the extension is housed in the `src` directory, organized into several subdirectories for modular development:

- **Core (`src/core`):** Includes the main background scripts that handle the non-UI logic of the extension, such as API communications and background processing.

- **UI (`src/ui`):** Contains all the user interface components for the extension, including HTML, CSS, and TypeScript files that define the look and feel as well as the interactivity of the extension.

#### Docker Integration
The project is Docker-ready, with Dockerfiles located in both the `demo/server` and `demo/ui` directories to containerize the server and UI respectively. A `docker-compose.yml` file is also provided to orchestrate the containers, ensuring that the entire demo environment can be deployed seamlessly.

This structured approach not only supports efficient development workflows but also ensures that contributors and new developers can easily understand and become involved in the project.
