# Project Tunnel

## Description

**Project Tunnel** is an innovative browser extension that serves two groundbreaking purposes: enabling passwordless authentication and replacing the traditional HTTPS protocol with **[KERI](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/) (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) Protocol** for securing web communications. This extension acts as a secure tunnel between websites and the Cardano Foundation's [cf-identity-wallet](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-identity-wallet), leveraging decentralized identity verification to ensure safe and private interactions on the web.

### Key Features

1. **Passwordless Authentication:**  
   Project Tunnel revolutionizes the way users authenticate with websites by enabling a passwordless system that requires active user participation. When visiting a website for the first time and opting to create a user account, the website sends a request to the user’s mobile identity wallet. This request asks the user to link a temporary AID, generated by the extension for that specific website, with a permanent AID and a corresponding credential stored in the wallet. The user must actively approve this linking to authorize the initial setup and subsequent login sessions. This linkage allows the server to associate the ephemeral AID with the user's identity, enabling secure encryption and decryption of web requests and responses.

2. **Revolutionary Security Protocol Replacement:**  
   One of the main innovations of Project Tunnel is its ability to replace the traditional HTTPS protocol with **KERI-based encryption**. This means that every request sent from the user's browser is encrypted using an ephemeral identifier (AID) managed by the extension for each specific website. Each request is securely transmitted to the server after passing through the extension, which encrypts the request body.

3. **Server-Side Decryption and Identity Verification:**  
   The server, equipped with the public identifier of the ephemeral AID, is linked to a credential stored in the user's mobile wallet. This credential is associated with the user's personal AID, which is also stored in the wallet. When the server receives the encrypted request, it can decrypt the body using the KERI protocol, thus eliminating the need for HTTPS security by relying on KERI’s identity-based encryption.

4. **Secure Response Handling:**  
   Similarly, when the server sends a response back to the user, the extension decrypts the response body using the private key of the ephemeral identifier that it manages for the specific website. This ensures that all server responses are processed through the extension before being shown to the user, maintaining end-to-end encryption.

### Why KERI Over HTTPS?

Project Tunnel uses KERI-based ephemeral identifiers to provide an additional layer of security that supersedes traditional HTTPS. Each website the user interacts with gets a unique ephemeral AID, ensuring secure, one-time encryption keys for each session. This approach bolsters privacy and ensures that the server can securely verify the user’s identity without relying on passwords.

By using KERI, we not only enable secure identity verification but also revolutionize the way web requests and responses are encrypted and decrypted, offering a more decentralized and privacy-respecting solution.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.16.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-tunnel.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd project-tunnel
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    npm install
    ```

### Scripts

The project comes with several predefined npm scripts to streamline common development tasks:

- **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

  Launches the project in development mode. Webpack will watch for file changes and automatically rebuild the project.

- **Build the project for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

  Compiles the project into the `dist` folder, optimized for production.

- **Lint your code:**

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

  Runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to check your code for potential issues and ensures adherence to coding standards.

- **Format your code:**

    ```bash
    npm run prettier
    ```

  Uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format your code according to the project's styling rules.

### Using the Extension
